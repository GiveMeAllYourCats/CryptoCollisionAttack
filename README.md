# CryptoCollisionAttack

The point of this code is to give you a sense of how secure a 256 bit security is in cryptocurrency by doing the following:

#### Recon

1. `node gather-stellar.js` Scanning blockchain (XLM, stellar) for recent transactions
2. Checking public addresses of transactions and save the ones that have a positive balance in `tokens-stellar.json`
3. Start over

#### Attack

1. `node index.js` to start the 'Collision Attack'
2. Creates steller wallets (keypairs) and checks if the public address is one of the saved ones
3. Notice how dumb your plan was to think it was possible to get a collision in 256 bit key size
4. Randomly get upset with how the world is
5. Existential crisis
